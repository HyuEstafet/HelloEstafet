# git_task

This repo was planned for my Git task from the training plan.
But I preferred creating a new repo - the one called Java-May-2022 as I had some confusions and wanted to start from scratch, 
and then pratice more (kept getting messages for the workspace.xml being modified and wanted to make sure that it wasn't something I did my mistake).

So please check the Java-May-2022 repo for the Git basics and Git advanced.
